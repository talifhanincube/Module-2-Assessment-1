                    <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                    <p>Giraffes are native to Africa, but each subspecies inhabits a different area where exist diverse types of vegetation. While giraffes used to roam most of the continent, now all subspecies dwell in defined areas where several of them are national parks. Giraffes feed on seeds, fruits and a wide variety of vegetation. However, their favorite food is the Acacia, a tree that has dangerous thorns which giraffes are adapted to manage with their thick saliva and prehensile tongue. Giraffe reproduction starts with males struggling to earn the right to mate. The dominant males have access to the available females of the herd, which after mating have a gestation period of around 15 months before delivering a six feet calf.</p>
                    <p>Giraffes have a unparallel anatomy in the animal world as no other animal has such height or a neck with a length that has puzzled scientist for a long time. Even more, they feature the longest tail of all terrestrial animals and a 20-inch long tongue. Giraffes do not have a distinctive sound because scientists think that some of the sounds the emit are in a range of frequencies that the human ear cannot detect. However, we can hear some of their vocalizations and watch their nonverbal communication.</p>
                    <p>Giraffe evolution still has many enigmas, but probably the explanation of the growth of such long neck is what has kept scientists busier. This feature has been the subject of many theories to justify the reason for its development.</p>
                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the giraffes at pen C01, right next to the Koalas.</p>
