                    <h3>PANDAS</h3>
                    <p>The panda, with its distinctive black and white coat, is adored by the world and considered a national treasure in China. This bear also has a special significance for WWF because it has been our logo since our founding in 1961. Pandas live mainly in temperate forests high in the mountains of southwest China, where they subsist almost entirely on bamboo. They must eat around 26 to 84 pounds of it every day, depending on what part of the bamboo they are eating. They use their enlarged wrist bones that function as opposable thumbs. A newborn panda is about the size of a stick of butter—about 1/900th the size of its mother—but females can grow up to about 200 pounds, while males can grow up to about 300 pounds as adults. These bears are excellent tree climbers despite their bulk.</p>
                    <p>The biological diversity of the panda’s habitat is unparalleled in the temperate world and rivals that of tropical ecosystems, making the giant panda an excellent example of an umbrella species conferring protection on many other species where pandas live. In other words, when we protect pandas, we invariably protect other animals that live around them, such as multicolored pheasants, the golden monkey, takin, and crested ibis. Pandas also bring sustainable economic benefits to many local communities through ecotourism.</p>
                    <p>Although they once roamed over a large portion of Asia, scientists currently estimate the population of wild Giant Pandas at only 1,864, making Giant Pandas a seriously vulnerable species. They are found living in the wild in a small area in Southwestern China along the Tibetan Plateau.There are approximately 600 in captivity in panda centers, zoos and wild life parks. Three zoos in the US currently have pandas; Memphis, Atlanta and Washington D.C. Giant Pandas are also found in zoos in Australia, Canada, Japan, Finland, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan, Mexico, France, Singapore, Spain, Austria, Belgium, Russia and the United Kingdom. Zoos outside of China must lease the animals from the Chinese government. This money is used for the preservation of the wild Giant Pandas</p>
